# 8023CodeBase
This code base has beeen developed for the frc 2023 charged up game and has been proven to be very effective. This code base has been developed from the Advanced Timed Skelaton 
Base and was created for the purpose of not having all the robot code in one file. Command Robot Codebase might be a little bit more effective but this is easier for the new members
to use until they fully learn how to use the command base.
